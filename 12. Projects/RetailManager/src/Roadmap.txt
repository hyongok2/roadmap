Application Ideas:
 * Actually interact with the inventory
 * Introduce a web-based inventory control system(Blazor?)
 * Web-based reporting
 * A Xamarin Forms app for a mobile register
 * Blazor app
 * Microservices


Phase 3 Roadmap
 1. Hook up inventory so it really increments/decrements
 2. Administrative portal(web-based)
 3. User Blazor WebAssembly PWA
 4. Dockerlize backend (API, etc.)
 5. Break off a piece as a microservice
 6. Upgrade to .NET 5
